<div class="block">* EdgeMom.java

 Created on June 16, 2005, 11:46 AM. One of the earliest of the Edge/CWB developments.
 <h1><u>Overview</u></h1>
 This process maintains all of the Threads on a running edge, monitors them, and periodically
 rereads its input file and :<br><br>
 1) kills a thread if its line has gone away<br>
 2) kills and restarts a thread if its line has changed<br>
 3) adds a thread for any new lines in the file<br>
 4) Every 10 minutes dumps the status information from each thread into the log<br>
 5) Sends process monitoring information to a central place.<br>
 6) if it finds a thread not "running" for 30 seconds, stop and restarts it.<br>
 7) Runs the EdgeMomMonitorServer for monitoring via Nagios (key value pairs)<br>
 8) Runs the EdgeStatusServer which dumps a status line from each thread to any connection<br>
 <br>
 <h1><u>Logging files </u></h1>
 This uses an internal TestStream to log using the usual 10 day schedule for closing the files. It
 forces this TestStream into the gov.usgs.anss.util.Util so that other software being run under
 this, will put their output into the edgemom.log? instead of a SESSION.OUT or other such.
 <br><br>
 The EdgeThread that run under here can either record information in the edgemom.log or they can
 have their own file. This is implemented automatically in the EdgeThread portion according to
 whether a "logname" for the thread has been set using the '>' or '>>' log output director. If
 not, they appear in edgemom.log with the "tag" of the thread prepended.

 <p>
 <h1><u>Memory Ring Buffer of MiniSEED</u></h1>
 This thread also starts and maintains the EdgeBlockQueue (in RAM Buffer of MiniSEED blocks). This
 queue is sized based on the -ebq nnn parameter or the setting of the eqbsize property in the
 edge.prop file. This memory buffer is used by any output class to examine the data data as it was
 processed into the EdgeMom and perform output operations. There are currently two main classes
 that use the memory buffer :<br>
 1) OutputInfrastructure which starts threads of type RingFile or RingServerSeedLink to put data
 into output ringfiles or use the datalink protocol to send the data to a ring server or QueryMom
 process. 2) EdgeBlockServer - this class is part of the replication protocol to cause files on an
 edge node to be created exactly the same on one or more CWB nodes. Every block inserted into the
 RAM ring is forwarded to every attached EdgeBlock client along with the place to put the block in
 the files and some index information. This is how most of the blocks get to the replicating
 servers.

 <p>
 <h1><u>Monitoring EdgeMom </u></h1>
 If the ebqsize is defined (this is a EdgeMom instance and not some other usage of this class)
 then and EdgeMomStatus and EdgeMomMonitor classes are started on the defined port for this
 instance number on this computer. These two servers dump certain information to a socket for each
 connection to the socket. The EdgeMomMonitor (port 7800 + instance) output is key-value pairs
 generally used by ICINGA for monitoring the application performance. The EdgeMomStatus (7890 +
 instance) server dump the same status output that happens every 10 minutes in the EdgeMom log
 file - basically a list of information about the edgemom and a status call to each of the EdgeMom
 managed threads. A user client can connect and see the latest status from the EdgeMom.

 <h1><u>The edge.prop properties file</u></h1>

 edge.prop - This property file is alway loaded, but the EDGEMOM/edge_$INSTANCE.prop file is
 always loaded if the instance is not "^" immediately after. This property file contains many
 parameters for the edgemom these include :

 <pre>
 Parameter      Description

 ndatapath      The number of datapaths for storing data.  There needs to be a nday and and
            datapath definition for each.  That is if ndatapath=3, then nday, nday1 and nday2
            must be defined as well as datapath, datapath1, and datapath2.

 nday?      The number of days of data held in edge mode in total (normally 10 on an edge node
            but 2000000 on a CWB node.  It is the total number of days of data that can be
            held on this node  on the ? path before the day files are reused.  Nday is for
            the first path, nday1 is for the 2nd path, etc.  For data received directly in
            this node (not via replication) if nday is less than 1000 the data files will be written
            on the first path only.  If nday > 1000 such files will be written on any path
            based on the free space available (this is CWB mode).  There must be a nday for each data path
            so if ndatapath=2, then nday and nday1 must be defined.

 Node         This is the node name or instance name – this overrides the actual
            node name returned by the operating system, if present (it always should be present).
            The end of the node should be a unique integer value.  So if a computer
            is being used which does not have a unique number, this property can be used
            to override it.  Example : if the servers actual name is “bruce” the node
            parameter can be set “Node=3#19” and the files from this instance will
            contain the 19.  Instances should be unique so node names like 1#2 are encouraged.

 datapath?      The path to some directory that will be used to store data.  If the
            corresponding nday is small, then this number of days of data will be
            on this path before reuse.  There must be a matching number of datapath?
            For the number of data paths (ndatapath), so if ndatapath=2, then datapath
            and datapath1 must be defined.  That is there must be one nday? for each datapath?\
            and there must be one for ndatapath and in order (nday, nday1, nday2, datapath,
            datapath1, datapath2 is legal, nday1, nday2, datapath1, datapath2 is not).

 datamask        This mask is used to put data in subdirectories on the datapaths.  The form is
           YYYY_DDD and can be shortened.  So if the mask is YYYY_D then the subdirectories
           will be named like 2012_1 and all files for year 2012 days 100-199 will be put
           in this directory (not yet implemented feature).

 daysize        The number of blocks in a day file when it is first created.

 extendsize     The number of blocks to add to a day file when more space is needed
 logfilepath    The path to the directory where the logs are to be written

 emailTo         The email address to receive certain messages from the system.  The alarm
           system generally handles e-mails now, but certain older code still sends e-mails
           to this address

 DBServer   The dabase URL used to configure this system – this leads to the edge, anss, portables, databases.
            The form is IP.ADR/PORT:database:vendor:schema.

 StatusDBServer The database URL used for status information (DAS Status, latency, holdings, etc).
            The form is IP.ADR/PORT:database:vendor:schema.

 MetaDBServer The database URL used for the metadata database.
            The form is IP.ADR/PORT:database:vendor:schema.

 KillPages      [false]|[true] kill any pages that might originate in the older paging system
            (not those done through the alarm/event system).  Most such pages have been
            replaced and this  variable will eventually be eliminated
 ebqsize          The size of the edge block queue in blocks.  This overrides the default in
            edgemom of 10000 blocks.  This queue holds blocks as they are received.
            Various output threads take blocks out of this queue independently.  The
            Replicator, and OutputInfrastructure use this queue as the source of data.

 SNWHost        If present, overrides where the SNWServer  SocketServer is expected to be running. Omit for no SNW

 SNWPort        If present, overrides where the SNWServer SocketServer is listening.

 SMTPServer  The IP address of the SMTP server which will handle outgoing e-mails from the SimpleSMTPThread or Alarm modules.

 SMTPFrom  This is the e-mail address to make as the “FROM” in e-mail messages.  This is
           often used like 'gacq3-vdl3@usgs.gov' so that the e-mails appear to come from
           certain nodes and users to make it easier to match e-mails with the source without looking at the body of the messages.

 statertms  Set the number of seconds to wait before a compression run becomes stale and needs to be forced out.  The default is
            1800.  This parameter can also be set on the command line with -stalertms nn.

 AlarmIP        The comma separated list of  IP addresses of the Alarm module server which
          should get UDP packets from the application SendAlarm generated messages.

 RTSServer      For use only with USGS stations using the RTS field modules, the IP address of the RTSServer software.

 StatusServer This is the IP address of the UdpChannel server(computer where status processing is handled for all nodes).

 <h1><u>Threads under edgemom</u></h1>
 See EdgeThread class document for latest details on the command line. By convention most lines
 that can be started in a EdgeMom are in the package gov.usgs.anss.edgemom, but it is not
 required. For instance this class is used in QueryMom and their many of the classes started are
 not in this package. Note the EdgeConfig GUI system allong with the other configuration processes
 generally are used to make files of this type. This is documented here both for nonGUI sites and
 to make understanding the edgemom.setup file easier.
 <br>
 Line format:<br>
 <PRE>
 tag[!][/pri]:class:[args][>[>]filename]
 tag       should be short and will be on all output from this thread through prt() to edgemom.log?.
           The ! indicates the thread does not support monitor calls (probably not a java thread)
 pri       is the thread priority - if omitted it will be 5.  Min priority=1 max=10
 class     if it does not contain any periods gov.usgs.anss.edgemom is presumed.  A fully qualified name can be used.
 args      command line args to the thread, should be parsed to control set up
 filename  output is redirected to filename.log? where the .log? is managed by the EdgeThread for the thread
           if a > is not present, output goes to edgemom.log? >> means append to the file on startup.
 </PRE>
 <br>
 There must be an EdgeMom line in the configuration file and the tag must be ' mom' so it sorts
 first in the output file. Here is an example edgemom.setup file :
 <br>
 <PRE>
#
#  Form is "unique_key:Class_of_Thread:Argument line [>][>>filename no extension]
# This is the mandatory ' mom' line.
 mom:gov.usgs.anss.edgemom.Edgemom:-nosnw -empty
# Get data from AFTAC
RIAR:RawInputServer:-p 7209
Echn:gov.usgs.anss.edgemom.EdgeChannelServer:-empty
Hydra:Hydra:-mhost 1.2.3.4 -host 1.2.3.255 -wait 181 >>hydra
# Serve edge blocks to the CWB
IFSrv:IndexFileServer:-p 7979 >>ifs
EBSrv:EdgeBLockServer:-p 7983 >>ebq
 </PRE>
 <br>
 <h1><u> Command Line arguments for EdgeMom</u></h1>
 The command line arguments can be passed on the command line, or if the command line arguments
 are not present they will be parsed from the "mom" line in the configuration file.
 <br>
 <PRE>
 example : java -jar EdgeMom.jar [-f filename][-dbg][-dbgblk][.....]
It is EdgeThread and the mother of the configured EdgeThreads :
 Tag   arg          Description
 -f        filename file name of setup file def=edgemom.setup
 -maxpurge n        Set limit to start purging open files that are 5 minutes unused to this level (def=500)
 -nosnw             Turnoff any output to the SNW server via SNWSender from any thread within this EdgeMom
 -stalesec nn       Set the stale setting for closing files to this number of seconds (def=43200)
 -stalertms nn      Set the number of seconds to wait for no additional data to RTMS before closing out a compression run (def=1800)
 -logname  file     Set the log file name to something other thant 'edgemom'
 -i        nn#nn    Set the instance to this value, this overrides edge.prop property Node!
 -prop     File     If present, this is the last property file to be loaded and will overrule any other
 Debugging related switches:
 -dbg               Turn on debugging
 -dbgblk            Turn on logging for each data block written
 -dbgebq            Turn on logging for each data block to replication
 -dbgrtms           Turn on debugging in RawToMiniSeed
 -dbgifr            Turn on debugging in IndexFileReplicator
 -eqbsave filename  Turn on saving of EdgeBlockQueue to journal filename
 -ebq    nnnn       Set size of the EdgeBLock Queue default="+ebqsize);
 -console           Set use console flag on - cause console output
 -notimeout         Turn off thread time outs - good for useing debugger
 -traceSteim        Turn on logging of Steim2.traceBackErrors()
 -notimeout         Set the EdgeThreadTimeout to no timeout mode
 -rtmstps           Set the RawToMiniSEED tolerance per sample (default in RTMS is 2 that is 1/2 sample interval for gap detection)
 -logname  name     Use name as the bases for log file (def=edgemom)
 -stalesec nnnn     Number of seconds before a file is considered stale
 -nozeroer          If present to no zero ahead, use this only on filesystems that return zero on unwritten blocks in a file
 -zeroahead         The zeroer is to try to be this many megabytes ahead of the last data block in megabytes (def=1)
 -?                 Listing of these options
