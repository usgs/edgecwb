 <h1><u>Overview</u></h1>
 This is the mom process for running other threads : CWBWaveServer, QueryServer, TrinetServer,  
 Memory Caches (QuerySpanCollection and MiniSeedCollection), and at the USGS certain compute intensive
 tasks needing access to the in-the-clear data from the QuerySpanCollection.  These compute intensive task
 include the FilterPicker, FK beam former, and the SubspaceDetector.  The QuerySpanCollector creates in-the-clear memory
 structures - that is the data are stored as arrays of simple intergers and not in any compressed or formatted
 form.
 <p>
 
 QueryMom actually runs the EdgeMom.java  class to do the thread startup and control.  Any special utilities
 related to QueryMom might be implemented in this class - i.e. the UpdateCreatedFromHoldings is run with the
 -updatecreated to this process and this performs its work and exits without actually starting a 
 QueryMom itself.
 <p>
 
 <h1><u>Setup file:</u></h1>
 QueryMoms are configured via a querymom.setup file in the home directory.  Each controlled thread
 appears on its own line starting with a short 'tag', the class of the thread to run, the arguments to that thread,
 and optionally an output log file.  In the sample querymom.setup all of the tags are short uppercase strings.
 There are a limited number of threads
 and options which can be started so there is a model querymom.setup in the EdgeConfig GUI SideFiles querymom.setup.example (see below). 
 The installation should create a side file named queryom.setup.$NODE.$ACCT (e.g. queryom.setup.gacq1.vdl) and 
 edit this file for the parameters on this station.
 <p>
 <h1><u>Basic rules</u></h1>
 
 This querymom.setup file is replicated below.  Here are a few basic rules :
 <p>
 1) The " Echn" ( EdgeChannelServer), " Mom" (EdgeMom) and "QS" (QueryServer) tags must always be enabled.
  <p>2) The "CWBWS" (CWBWaveServer) provides earthworm and Winston wave server access, so must be enabled for these services.
  <p>3) If there is going to be memory buffering of data the the "DLQS" (DataLinkToQueryServer) must be enabled.
 For this to work there must be EdgeMoms with an OutputInfrastructure 'sendto' using RingServerSeedLink threads pointed at this service to
 populate it with data.
  <p>4) Either "QSC" (QuerySpanCollection) and/or "MSC" (MiniSeedCollection) can be enabled to make memory buffering.
 The QSC is used to populate in-the-clear data for either earthworm/Winston cached in memory.  The MSC is used
 to populate the memory cache with MiniSEED data used by the TrinetServer.
  <p>5)  The TrinetServer requires that a "CWBWS" be running to populate the metadata structures.
  <p>6)  Both/either CWBWS or TWS will run fine without memory buffering - all data then comes from disk.
  <p>
 
 <h1><u>Load switch</u></h1>
 Use of the -load switch - The use of the -load in both QSC and MSC is optional.  This switch causes the memory buffers to be populated
 from disk at startup.  This can be a CPU intensive process.  The -load argument is the number of threads to 
 allow to do this population of memory.  The more threads the faster it will populate and the more CPU and other
 resources will be consumed.  If there are lot of cores on the system, then more threads can be allowed but it is
 really a tuning exercise to determine the number of threads to use.  For a 3000-channel system of BH and HH data,
 a -load 2 kept 8 cores about 40-80 % busy and took 20 minutes to load 3 hours of data in memory.  Your milage 
 may vary, so beware setting -load too high.
 <p>
 <h1><u>CWBWaveServer Thread - populating the menu</u></h1>
 <u>Preferred method</u> - The preferred way to populate the menu is to NOT use -holdings.  In this mode the
 start time from each channel is taken from the channel table's 'created' field.  Normally, the first
 data from than channel is available shortly after startup.  However, if data are being loaded in the past, the ;created' value will not reflect
 the earliest data.  The QueryMom.jar can be run with the switch "-updatecreated" and this will connect to the 
 holdings database, look for the earliest data from each channel, and set the created date to this earliest time.
 This should be done periodically on any system which is getting data loaded from the past in order to keep this field 
 up-to-date.  The latest time in the MENU will normally come from the UdpChannel server monitoring real time data
 acquisition (this is the same service as ChannelDisplay uses to get information).  For this to work, the edge.prop
 StatusServer property must point to the server running UdpChannel.  If this is all setup, the ending time in 
 MENUs will be very close to the time of the last data received.  If a UdpChannel is not available and 'lastdata' 
 field of the channel table is within the last day, the latest time will be set to the
 current time.  If the 'lastdata' field is older than one day, the latest time in the MENU will be the 'lastdata' time.  
 The 'lastdata' field is normally up to 6 hours out of date which is the reason for this algorithm.
 Note that the beginning time of the menu will
 be shortened by the -daysback switch.  So, on a node only keeping 10 days worth of data, setting '-daysback 10'
 makes all menus report a beginning time 10 days in the past (assuming this is after the channel table's 'created' field).
 <p>
 <u>Holdings_method</u> - This method is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.  This method
 gets the menu starting time for each channel by scanning the holdings, holdingshist, and holdingshist2 tables for the
 earliest holdings.  This can be a very time consuming as the holdings tables are not bounded.  The latest
 time in the menus comes from a UdpChannel if the StatusServer property in edge.prop is setup and a 
 connection to the UdpChannel is possible.  If a UdpChannel is not available and channel tables's 'lastdata' field is within the last day,
 the latest time will be set to the
 current time. The value of the field 'lastdata' is older than one day, the latest data value will be set to the 
 value of the 'lastdata' field.  Last data is normally up to 6 hours out of date which is the reason for this algorithm.
 <p>
 <h1><u>Winston Metadata emulation</u></h1>
 The Winston wave server provides metadata such as coordinates and instruments as part of its
 services.  This information comes from the NEIC MetaDataServer. By default CWBWaveServer uses the NEIC 
 public MDS to populate these values.  This is done after other data intensive processes related to gathering
 MENU beginning and end times is completed, so generally at least a minute or five after startup.  The setting
 of the metadata can take a few minutes depending on the number of channels which have to be loaded from 
 the MDS.  The Winston commands requiring metadata will return default values (like zero coordinates) soon after startup, but
 the real metadata might not be populated for several minutes after startup.  Because of this, there can be problems with
 starting a client like Swarm which is building a map and hence needs the coordinates populated, if it is 
 started soon after a QueryMom start up.  Simply restarting Swarm after the warmup period will solve this
 problem.
 
 <p>
 <h1><u>Example Setup file </u></h1>
 Below is the example querymom.setup file.  Its latest version is kept in the databases as querymom.setup.example.  
 There are enough comments about the switches to allow a user familiar with QueryMom to setup a new one without
 referring to the javadocs for more details.  For more information see the javadocs for each individual thread
 started from this configuration file.

 <h1><u>Command Line Considerations</u></h1>
 <u>Setting the heap size</u> - When using memory caching the total heap size needs to be set to some value bigger
 than the actual memory used when QueryMom reaches equilibrium after several hours.  The memory heap can be adjusted
 by looking in the log file querymom.logN for the string "maxMem".  These log lines are generated every 
 10 minutes or so.  After the system is static the total heap size can be adjust to 20% bigger than the
 values of "totMem".  The heap space above "totMem" has never been allocated by the program so setting the
 heap at this level insures some room for growth.  On linux systems you need to have more physical memory
 than can be used, so larger memories are needed on QueryMom systems with memory caching.  If there 
 is not enough memory, the system will start paging and performance will be very bad.
 <p>
 <u>Garbage Collection when using memory cache </u>- The java garbage collector can do some odd "stop-the-world" 
 collections if the QueryMom is started with default values.  There are specialized scripts for starting
 QueryMom which set various memory tuning parameters to smooth out these.  Basically it has been found that
 forcing the size of the Eden area (-XX:NewSize=200m -XX:MaxNewSize=300m) keeps things so shorter garbage collections
 run more frequently.  The -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100 has also been shown to help with this process.  Generally,
 the frequent garbage collections will run in under 100 millis so the responsiveness is good.  However,
 until the memory areas are fully populated and QueryMom has been running for several hours, there will be
 stop-the-world (sometime called full) garbage collections that will last several seconds.  Since some 
 objects need to be moved from Eden to Old as the program runs, some stop-the-world events seem to be
 inevitable.  However, using these parameters has made it so these happen very rarely after the program has
 been running several hours so users generally to not observe them.  
 <p>
 
 <h1><u> Non standard execution</u></h1>
 All other configuration for a QueryMom process in a non-standard manner.    
 The switches below are <b>NEVER</b> used to run QueryMom in
 its normal manner.  They allow other special functions to be run such as tests on certain classes
 and to allow the WaveServerClient to be run from the normal .jar file.
 <p>
 <pre>
 switch   Args    Description 
 -rsc            Run the RateSpanCalculator.main() and exits when its done. More info in that clasee
 -wsc    many    Run the WaverServerClient from the QueryMom - all arguments are passed to WaveServerClient - see that class for details
 -cwbws  many    Ditto - another way to invoke the WaveServerClient
 -updatecreated  This runs the UpdateCreatedFromHoldings class which scans holdings and updates channel.created to the earliest appearance of a channel
